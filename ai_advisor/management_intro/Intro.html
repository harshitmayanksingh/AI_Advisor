    <h4 class="card-title">Designing a leadership-readiness sandbox</h4>
    <p class="card-text">This short demo mirrors the financial advising flow but focuses on management decisions. You will log a few project levers, then see a lightweight AI narrative about how those levers influence a leader's progress and success.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Think of <strong>multipliers</strong> that move a leader forward: clarity of scope, stakeholder confidence, and team momentum.</li>
      <li>Estimate <strong>weights</strong> for these factors: some dimensions matter more than others depending on the project.</li>
      <li>Use the AI summary as a <strong>confidence check</strong> for risk-taking and course corrections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0">Click “Next” to enter a few inputs and preview the management-focused report.</p>
